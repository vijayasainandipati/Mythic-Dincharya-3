## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saffron (#FFA500) to represent knowledge, sacrifice, and courage. It evokes the era's cultural significance and the energy of the characters.
- Background color: Desaturated beige (#F5F5DC), offering a soft, parchment-like backdrop that doesn't distract from the content, and helps in a light scheme.
- Accent color: Deep maroon (#800000) for key interactive elements and highlights, such as the character's name. This provides contrast, signifies royalty, and evokes the intensity of the Mahabharata war.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern but accessible feel
- Headline font: 'Playfair' (serif) to reflect classical stories and values, but pairing that with a friendly sans-serif so it remains very kid-friendly.
- Use icons inspired by elements from the Mahabharata (bows, arrows, chariots, conch shells).
- Kid-friendly design with large fonts, emoji-rich content, and colorful cards for information.
